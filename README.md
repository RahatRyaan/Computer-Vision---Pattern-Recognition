# Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition

Abstract



Skin cancer classification is a critical aspect of computer-aided diagnosis, and
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be powerful tools in this domain.
In this study, we specifically investigate the performance of a CNN, with a focus on the
Xception architecture, on the "Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000" dataset. Our CNN
model achieves a compelling training accuracy of 99.96% and a noteworthy testing
accuracy of 81.49%. The training process spans 30 epochs, incorporating a learning rate
reduction strategy after the 11th epoch. The results underscore the efficacy of CNNs,
particularly the Xception model, in accurate skin cancer classification, providing
valuable insights for dermatological diagnostics and contributing to the ongoing
discourse in the field.
